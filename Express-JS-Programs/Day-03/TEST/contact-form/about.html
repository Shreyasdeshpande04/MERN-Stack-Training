      I am a student currently in my <b></b>Final year of Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. This website has been created with the purpose of sharing valuable information about exploring Maharashtra.

      <br><br>
      This project is part of my Web Development Training at <strong>Fortune Cloud Technologies, Pune</strong>. It is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to enhance tourism operations, targeting both travel agencies and individual travelers.

      <br><br>
      The <strong> Mumbai Tourism</strong> website is built to offer an intuitive platform for tourists to explore destinations, plan trips, and make bookings effortlessly.

      <br><br>
      Welcome to the <strong> Mumbai Tourism</strong> website! Here, you will find information on historic, pilgrimage, and wildlife destinations throughout Maharashtra â€” and much more.
